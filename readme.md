Hi there!
This is my react repo. It includes the following projects:-

EmojiPedia- This React application displays a list of emoji cards with their corresponding information using data from emojipedia. Each Card component is created using the NewCard function, which maps over the emojipedia array and passes the relevant emoji data (id, emoji, name, meaning) as props to each Card.

Clock- This React application displays the current time and updates it every second. It utilizes the useState hook to manage the state of the time and the setInterval function to update the time every second

ToDoList- This React application is a simple To-Do List that allows users to add and delete tasks. It uses functional components and React hooks (useState) to manage the state of the application.
